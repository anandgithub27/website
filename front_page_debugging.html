  Front Page planning
  Things I want in here:
  Picture of me:
  - preferably in center
    - Have it take up part of the screen if on a bigger device, else have it take up all part of the screen if on a smaller device?
  - Maybe it rotates?
  a quick summary of what I do
  - Perhaps at the very top?
  hyperlinks to other pages
  - The other pages should be calendar, comedy and youtube, contact information
  - Underneath the image
  - Have all the divs on one page, and have the hyperlinks be buttons that scroll down
    - Smooth scrolling: look into css's scroll-behavior: smooth
  - Have it highlight and get bigger upon selection
  Formatting: 
  - for hyperlinks:
    --light gray background
  - light gray background
