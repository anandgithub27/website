<!--
Things I want in here:
Picture of me:
- preferably in center
  - Have it take up part of the screen if on a bigger device, else have it take up all part of the screen if on a smaller device?
- Maybe it rotates?
a quick summary of what I do
- Perhaps at the very top?
hyperlinks to other pages
- The other pages should be calendar, comedy and youtube, contact information
- Underneath the image
- Have all the divs on one page, and have the hyperlinks be buttons that scroll down
  - Smooth scrolling: look into css's scroll-behavior: smooth
- Have it highlight and get bigger upon selection
Formatting: 
light gray background
